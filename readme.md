# Create a program that :)
on the basis of the inflation table of the loan interest rate, the initial loan amount and the fixed installment amount, will calculate the debt value for each month for the next 2 years.

Have the program print the following line for each month:
Your outstanding loan amount is X, this is Y less than the previous month.

Write the program so that the amount of the initial loan, the interest rate on the loan (above inflation), and the installment amount are taken from the standard input (terminal).

Examples of loan values and the formula for its calculation can be found in the appendix above. Copy the inflation values for each month from it.
